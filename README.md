# Introduction Database Systems Project  
# TaskMate â€“ A Personal Task Management System

TaskMate is a CRUD-based personal task manager web application developed using **Flask (Python)** for the backend, **SQLite** as the database, and **HTML/CSS with Bootstrap** for the frontend. This project demonstrates a database-driven web platform where users can manage their daily tasks, assign multiple categories, and filter/search by task status and title.

## Project Setup

### Database Setup

1. **Database Creation**:
   - The database schema is defined in `create.sql`.
   - Sample data is added using `insert.sql` which populates user, task, and category tables for testing.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - The app uses **SQLite** as its backend.
   - Running the app will automatically connect to or create `taskmate.db` using the structure defined in `create.sql`.

### Running the Application

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Navigate to the project folder and install Flask:
     ```bash
     pip install flask
     ```

2. **Start the Flask Server**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - The app will run on **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** by default.

3. **Accessing the Application**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - You can use the following routes:
     - **Register**: `/register`  
     - **Login**: `/login`  
     - **Dashboard**: `/dashboard`  
     - **Add Task**: `/add_task`  
     - **Edit Task**: `/edit_task/<task_id>`  
     - **Delete Task**: `/delete_task/<task_id>`  
     - **Logout**: `/logout`
